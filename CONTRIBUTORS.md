# Contibutors Guide

When making a new contribution to the project, you'll either want to **fix stuff** or to **make stuff**.

## General

- Use [draft PRs](https://libmedium.batsense.net/pareture/draft-pull-requests-f2c0c3ce0912) for your changes. This helps us give feedback before a merge!
- Commit early and often! Take care to include helpful commit messages to describe your changes.
- If necessary, document your changes.
- Remember to make tests for any new features you add.
- If it's possible, you can create a [linked pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) on an issue.

## Fixing Stuff

Please make an issue if you find a bug/problem. If you want to fix something that's already been mentioned in an issue, please:

1. Say that you're fixing it
2. Fix it and submit a PR

## Making Stuff

If you have a feature you want added to the project, you should make a new issue and talk about it first. If everything sounds good, please say that you're working on it and create your draft PR. Make sure to submit it when you're done! :)
